Session 05
==========

Free Book [Ruby Best Practises][rbbestprac], using github for the errata.

The [screen casts on Pragmatic Programmer][pragprog] have also been highly recommended $35 for all 7. most ~30 minutres long would be good 1 per session + discussion.
[Peep Code][peepcode] also keeps coming up. They just seem to be paid podcasts hopefully the cost is justified and they ware a hyigh quality resource.

[Shoes][shooes] was discussed as a easy to learn light weight graphical system for Ruby.
