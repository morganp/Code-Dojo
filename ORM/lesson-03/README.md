Lesson-3
=========

Following on from Lesson 2 we shall be using retrieving data from the database and displaying it in the terminal.
To create the database and add some data just run:

    ruby create_database.rb

Migrations should always be used when modifing tables but are not normally used when adding or removing data. For this lesson the Database and some data will be created and we will be trying to retrieve it.

In sequel and then Active Record retrive the first, last then second Post.
Another step would be to return all posts and iterate over them printing out there info.

Again a good way to visualise the database is the [sqlite firefox plugin][ffox_plugin] although this will not be requied once you have completed this lesson.
